      Traveling light's how it usually goes. Mind open wide with heart open closed. Start ar the bottom, <!--but time only knowns. Unravel the tale of the world that I chose. Seek an answer in an infinite skyline, a promising refrain. But the meaning tends to vanish when it's me, myself and I again. I don't complain about it, I just don't have the time, half the time, wondering weather the weather will give me some sunshine.-->
